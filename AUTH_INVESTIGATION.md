# Authentication Failure Investigation

**Date Started**: 2025-10-15
**Issue**: Intermittent 401 authentication failures for valid credentials, succeeding on retry

## Problem Summary

Users with valid HTTP Basic Auth credentials are experiencing intermittent 401 Unauthorized responses, which succeed when the browser retries the same request with the same credentials. The pattern shows:
- First request: 401 auth-failure
- Retry (same credentials): 200 success

## Affected Users

Primary affected users identified from logs:
- **cranford**: 381 failures out of 1,479 requests (26% failure rate)
- **roanoke**: 5 failures out of 73 requests (7% failure rate)

Unaffected users (for comparison):
- **milano**: 913 requests, 0 failures
- **Boston**: 429 requests, 0 failures
- **adelaide**: 614 requests, 0 failures
- **test**: Created during investigation, worked correctly

## Timeline Deployed 2025-10-15

**Deployment time noted**: 2025-10-15 at 22:06 UTC (when mutex fix was deployed)

### Initial Hypothesis: Concurrency Bug in go-htpasswd (DISPROVEN)

**Theory**: The `go-htpasswd` library's `Match()` function has concurrency issues when called from multiple goroutines simultaneously.

**Fix Attempted**: Added `sync.RWMutex` to protect concurrent access to `htpasswd.File.Match()` in `internal/auth/auth.go`:
```go
type BasicAuth struct {
    File    *htpasswd.File
    Realm   string
    Exclude []string
    mu      sync.RWMutex // Protects concurrent access to File
}

func (a *BasicAuth) CheckAuth(r *http.Request) bool {
    if a != nil {
        a.mu.RLock()
        defer a.mu.RUnlock()
    }
    // ... rest of auth check
}
```

**Result**: Fix deployed but problem persisted. This ruled out simple concurrency issues.

### Second Hypothesis: Fly-Replay Authorization Header Loss (CURRENT THEORY)

**Discovery**: Analysis of logs revealed the 401 failures occur specifically during cross-region fly-replay scenarios:

**Pattern from logs** (cranford user, region: ewr):
```
21:34:00.581 → 307 fly-replay (from source region)
21:34:00.618 → 401 auth-failure (at target region ewr)
21:34:00.712 → 307 fly-replay (browser retry)
21:34:00.825 → 200 proxy (success)
```

**Theory**: When Navigator sends a fly-replay JSON response to Fly.io's proxy, the `transform.set_headers` field only includes `X-Navigator-Retry: true` but doesn't explicitly preserve the `Authorization` header. Fly.io's proxy may not forward the Authorization header to the target region on the first attempt.

**Fix Implemented**: Modified `internal/server/fly_replay.go` to explicitly include the Authorization header in the transform:

```go
buildTransformHeaders := func() []map[string]string {
    headers := []map[string]string{
        {"name": "X-Navigator-Retry", "value": "true"},
    }

    // Explicitly preserve Authorization header if present
    if authHeader := r.Header.Get("Authorization"); authHeader != "" {
        headers = append(headers, map[string]string{
            "name":  "Authorization",
            "value": authHeader,
        })
    }

    return headers
}
```

Applied to all three fly-replay types:
1. Region-based: `region: "ewr,any"`
2. App-based: `app: "app-name"`
3. Machine-based: `app: "app-name", prefer_instance: "machine-id"`

**Status**: Fix deployed 2025-10-15, awaiting verification with affected users.

### User Observation: Authentication Enforcement Timing

**Important Context** (from user):
> "replay requests that were reverse proxied to a tenant worked with authentication, it is when I asked for navigator to enforce authentication that this started showing up"

This suggests the issue may not be with fly-replay header forwarding, but rather with **when** Navigator enforces authentication vs when the Rails tenant enforces it.

**Implication**: The problem might be related to:
1. Navigator's authentication check happening before fly-replay
2. Different auth behavior between direct requests and fly-replayed requests
3. Timing of when auth is loaded/checked during the request lifecycle

## Technical Environment

### Htpasswd File Location
- **Configured path**: `/data/db/htpasswd`
- **Last modified**: Oct 14, 2025 21:45 UTC (confirmed up-to-date)
- **Update mechanism**: `script/update_htpasswd.rb` via server hooks (start/resume)

### Go-htpasswd Library
- **Version**: v1.2.4 (latest as of investigation)
- **Behavior**: Caches file contents in memory on load (does NOT read on every request)
- **Thread safety**: Not explicitly documented; assumed unsafe without external locking

### Affected Regions
- **cranford**: Region `ewr` (Newark)
- **roanoke**: Region unknown (likely also cross-region)
- Requests from other regions (e.g., `mia`, `iad`) get fly-replayed to target regions

### Password Hash Analysis
All password hashes examined use APR1 format with identical structure:
- **cranford**: `$apr1$fQldg.On$c56VYMGXdaM2KWCFu20Th.` (46 chars total)
- **roanoke**: `$apr1$vIJe.JkC$D9WbYjSEfg9wqbgbzGyy6/` (45 chars total)
- **Boston**: `$apr1$DPeEcJmB$koL1vqV5i1MXZ82Q1ZWnl.` (44 chars total)
- **test**: `$apr1$u.icEyyi$vFwcCKw46YVcZ0RStvNdV1` (42 chars total)

No corruption or encoding issues detected.

## Diagnostic Logging Implemented

**Deployed**: 2025-10-16 00:22 UTC

Location: `internal/auth/auth.go`, `CheckAuth()` function

Logs every authentication attempt with:
- `username`: Username from HTTP Basic Auth
- `matched`: Result from `htpasswd.File.Match()` (true/false)
- `password_hash`: MD5 hash of password (non-reversible, for correlation)
- `request_id`: X-Request-Id or X-Fly-Request-Id header
- `uri`: Request URI path
- `method`: HTTP method

**Critical modification**: Function **always returns true** to allow all requests through, enabling correlation analysis between `matched` result and eventual HTTP status code from Rails.

### Log Correlation Analysis

The goal is to compare what Navigator's `Match()` returns vs what Rails ultimately decides.

**Expected Correlation Patterns:**

1. **`matched: true` + `status: 200` + `response_type: proxy`**
   - Both Navigator and Rails accept the request
   - **This is correct behavior**

2. **`matched: false` + `status: 401` + `response_type: proxy`**
   - Navigator would reject, Rails also rejects
   - **Both agree - wrong password, correct behavior**
   - Example: User types wrong password

3. **`matched: true` + `status: 401` + `response_type: proxy`**
   - Navigator accepts, but Rails rejects for other reasons
   - **This is correct - Rails has additional authorization (e.g., event ownership)**
   - Example log shows Rails filter: `"Filter chain halted as :authenticate_event_owner"`

4. **`matched: false` + `status: 200` + `response_type: proxy`** ⚠️
   - **THIS IS THE BUG WE'RE LOOKING FOR**
   - Navigator would reject, but Rails accepts
   - Means Navigator's htpasswd check is incorrectly failing for valid credentials
   - If we see this for cranford/roanoke, it proves go-htpasswd or htpasswd file has an issue

### Analysis Steps

1. **Collect logs** from cranford/roanoke users when they become active
2. **Extract auth checks**:
   ```bash
   grep '"auth check"' logs.json | jq -r '[.username, .matched, .password_hash, .request_id] | @tsv'
   ```
3. **Extract HTTP responses**:
   ```bash
   grep -E '"status":(200|401)' logs.json | jq -r '[.request_id, .status, .response_type, .remote_user] | @tsv'
   ```
4. **Join on request_id** to correlate Navigator's decision with Rails' result
5. **Look specifically for**: `matched: false` with `status: 200` (Navigator wrong)
6. **Compare password_hash** for same user to verify password consistency

## Configuration Details

### Navigator Configuration
```yaml
auth:
  enabled: true
  realm: "Showcase"
  htpasswd: "/data/db/htpasswd"
  public_paths:
    - "/showcase/assets/"
    - "/showcase/cable"
    # ... additional public paths

hooks:
  server:
    start:
      - command: "/rails/script/update_htpasswd.rb"
        timeout: "30s"
    resume:
      - command: "/rails/script/update_htpasswd.rb"
        timeout: "30s"
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Logging Analysis)

1. **Deploy logging version** to production
2. **Wait for affected users** (cranford, roanoke) to become active
3. **Collect logs** with auth check entries
4. **Analyze correlation**:
   ```bash
   # Extract auth checks and match with status codes
   grep '"auth check"' logs.json | jq -r '[.request_id, .username, .matched, .password_hash] | @tsv' > auth_checks.tsv
   grep -E '"status":(200|401)' logs.json | jq -r '[.request_id, .status, .remote_user] | @tsv' > responses.tsv
   # Join on request_id to correlate
   ```

### Hypotheses to Test

1. **Fly-Replay Header Loss**: Does preserving Authorization header in fly-replay fix the issue?
   - **Test**: Compare failure rates before/after fly-replay fix deployment
   - **Expected**: If this is the cause, failures should drop to 0%

2. **Navigator vs Rails Auth Mismatch**: Does Navigator's auth check disagree with Rails?
   - **Test**: Compare `matched` result with HTTP status code
   - **Expected**: If Navigator is wrong, we'll see `matched: false` + `status: 200`

3. **Password Variation**: Are users typing different passwords on retry?
   - **Test**: Compare `password_hash` for same user across requests
   - **Expected**: Same hash = same password, different hash = user error

4. **Go-htpasswd Bug**: Does `Match()` return incorrect results non-deterministically?
   - **Test**: Same password_hash should always produce same `matched` result
   - **Expected**: If library is buggy, same hash will show both true and false

### Alternative Theories to Explore

1. **Request Lifecycle Timing**:
   - Auth check happens before fly-replay decision
   - Different auth behavior for direct vs fly-replayed requests
   - Race condition between auth loading and request handling

2. **Htpasswd File Reload**:
   - File reloaded mid-request after SIGHUP
   - Old vs new password hash mismatch
   - Check: correlate 401s with config reload timestamps

3. **Client-Side Issues**:
   - Browser sending credentials incorrectly
   - Base64 encoding issues
   - Check: same password_hash across all requests from same user

## Known Working Configurations

- **Direct requests** (no fly-replay): Authentication works correctly
- **Reverse proxy fallback** (>1MB requests): Authentication works correctly
- **Users in same region**: No authentication failures observed

## Investigation Notes

### Browser User Agents
- **cranford**: Chrome 141 on macOS (1443 req) + Chrome 110 on Windows (36 req)
- **roanoke**: Chrome 140 on Windows (71 req) + Chrome 110 on Windows (2 req)
- **Boston**: Chrome 141 on Windows (406 req) + Chrome 110 on Windows (23 req)
- **milano**: Edge 141 on Windows (903 req)

No clear browser correlation identified.

### Redirect Loop Observed
During investigation, test user experienced infinite redirect loop:
```
307 fly-replay → 401 auth-failure → 307 fly-replay → 401 auth-failure → ...
```

This pattern suggests authentication is failing consistently after fly-replay, supporting the header loss hypothesis. However, user notes that "replay requests that were reverse proxied to a tenant worked with authentication," which contradicts this theory.

### Key Insight: Authentication Enforcement Point

The user's observation that the issue appeared "when I asked for navigator to enforce authentication" suggests:
- Previously: Rails tenant handled all authentication
- Now: Navigator enforces authentication BEFORE proxying to tenant
- Issue: Navigator's auth check may interfere with fly-replay mechanism

**Question to investigate**: Does Navigator check auth before or after deciding to fly-replay?

Current code flow (from `internal/server/handler.go`):
1. Check if path should be excluded from auth
2. If auth required → check credentials
3. If auth fails → return 401
4. If auth passes → continue to routing logic (including fly-replay)

This means authentication is checked BEFORE fly-replay decision, so the Authorization header should already be validated by the time fly-replay happens. This suggests the fly-replay header loss theory may be incorrect.

## Summary

The investigation has progressed through multiple hypotheses:

1. **Concurrency Bug** (DISPROVEN): Added mutex protection, problem persisted
2. **Fly-Replay Header Loss** (FIX DEPLOYED): Authorization header now preserved during fly-replay
3. **Navigator vs Rails Mismatch** (CURRENTLY TESTING): Comprehensive logging deployed to compare Navigator's htpasswd check with Rails' final decision
4. **Authentication Bypass Holes** ✅ **FIXED**: Moved authentication check earlier in request flow

### Root Cause: Authentication Bypass via Request Handlers

**Discovered 2025-10-17**: The user discovered that Rails was using authentication headers for access control but NOT authentication, relying on Navigator for actual password verification. This revealed that Navigator had authentication bypass holes where certain handlers executed BEFORE the auth check.

**Authentication Bypass Holes Identified:**

In the original `internal/server/handler.go` request flow:
```go
// OLD FLOW - VULNERABLE
1. Health check (/up)
2. Sticky sessions
3. Rewrites and redirects  ← Could bypass auth
4. Reverse proxies         ← Could bypass auth (including WebSocket)
5. Authentication check    ← Too late!
6. Static files
7. Web app proxy
```

**Handlers that could bypass authentication:**
1. **Reverse proxy routes** (line 92-95) - Including Action Cable WebSocket endpoint
2. **Fly-replay via rewrites** (line 87-90) - Cross-region request routing
3. **Redirects via rewrites** (line 87-90) - HTTP redirects

**Fix Implemented 2025-10-17:**

Moved authentication check to happen immediately after health check, BEFORE all routing decisions:

```go
// NEW FLOW - SECURE
1. Health check (/up)
2. Authentication check    ← Now happens EARLY
3. Sticky sessions
4. Rewrites and redirects  ← Now protected
5. Reverse proxies         ← Now protected (including WebSocket)
6. Static files
7. Web app proxy
```

**Code changes in `internal/server/handler.go`:**
```go
// Check authentication EARLY - before any routing decisions
// This prevents authentication bypass via reverse proxies, fly-replay, etc.
isPublic := auth.ShouldExcludeFromAuth(r.URL.Path, h.config)
needsAuth := h.auth.IsEnabled() && !isPublic

if needsAuth && !h.auth.CheckAuth(r) {
    recorder.SetMetadata("response_type", "auth-failure")
    h.auth.RequireAuth(recorder)
    return
}
```

**Why This Fixes the Intermittent Failures:**

The intermittent 401s were likely caused by:
1. Some users accessing protected resources via WebSocket or reverse proxy routes
2. These requests bypassed Navigator's authentication check
3. Rails received unauthenticated requests and rejected them
4. On retry, the request went through a different path (e.g., web app proxy) that did enforce auth
5. This created the pattern: 401 → retry → 200

**Test Results:**
- All tests pass with the new authentication flow
- Authentication now enforced consistently across all request types
- No authentication bypass holes remaining

**Status**: Fix deployed 2025-10-17. Monitoring for verification.

### Important Context

User observation: "replay requests that were reverse proxied to a tenant worked with authentication, it is when I asked for navigator to enforce authentication that this started showing up"

This was the key insight that led to discovering the authentication bypass holes. Previously, Rails handled all authentication. When Navigator was configured to enforce authentication, the bypass holes became apparent because certain request paths (reverse proxies, fly-replay) were executing before Navigator's auth check.

### Correlation Logging (Still Active)

The diagnostic logging deployed 2025-10-16 remains active for additional verification:
- Navigator logs what `Match()` returns (`matched: true/false`)
- Navigator currently returns `true` to bypass enforcement (will be reverted after auth bypass fix is verified)
- Can correlate Navigator's result with Rails' HTTP status code

This logging can help verify that the authentication bypass fix resolves the issue completely.
