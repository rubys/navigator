# Navigator Refactoring Plan and Status

This document tracks the ongoing refactoring effort to improve code maintainability, reduce complexity, and enhance separation of concerns in the Navigator codebase.

## Overall Goals

1. **Reduce file complexity**: Break down large files into smaller, focused modules
2. **Improve separation of concerns**: Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility
3. **Enhance maintainability**: Make code easier to understand, test, and modify
4. **Eliminate duplication**: Extract common patterns into reusable components
5. **Maintain stability**: All refactoring must pass existing tests with no behavioral changes

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Large File Analysis

### Completed Refactorings

#### ‚úÖ internal/server/handler.go (COMPLETED)

**Original size**: 722 LOC

---

### Phase 2: Code Duplication (IN PROGRESS)

**Status**: High-priority extractions completed
**Date Started**: Sep 30, 2025

#### ‚úÖ Completed Extractions

1. **Duration Parsing Enhancement** ‚Üí `internal/utils/time.go`
   - Enhanced existing `ParseDurationWithDefault()` with logging
   - Added `ParseDurationWithContext()` for contextual error logging
   - Replaced 23 occurrences of manual duration parsing with logging
   - Files updated: `hooks.go`, `manager.go`, `webapp.go`
   - Added comprehensive tests

2. **Error Constructors** ‚Üí `internal/errors/errors.go` (NEW PACKAGE)
   - Created domain-specific error constructor functions
   - Categories: Process, Config, Proxy, Auth, Server errors
   - Uses proper error wrapping with `%w` for error chains
   - Ready for use across 43 identified locations
   - Comprehensive test coverage with unwrapping tests

3. **Logging Helpers** ‚Üí `internal/logging/logging.go` (NEW PACKAGE)
   - Created structured logging helper functions
   - Categories: Request, Proxy, Process, WebApp, Config, Server, Hooks, Cleanup
   - Reduces 271 repetitive slog calls to simple function calls
   - Ready for adoption across codebase
   - Full test coverage with output verification

**Benefits achieved**:
- ‚úÖ Reduced code duplication in duration parsing (23 ‚Üí 3 occurrences)
- ‚úÖ Standardized error construction patterns (ready for 43 locations)
- ‚úÖ Simplified structured logging (ready for 271 locations)
- ‚úÖ Better error wrapping and unwrapping support
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging with context information
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (100+ tests)

#### üîÑ Pending Adoption

**Next steps** (optional, based on need):
1. Gradually adopt `internal/errors` constructors across codebase
2. Gradually adopt `internal/logging` helpers to reduce verbosity
3. Extract HTTP utilities (client IP, metadata extraction)
4. Extract test utilities (temp directory helpers)
5. Extract Fly.io context helpers

**Approach for future adoption**:
- Adopt incrementally, one module at a time
- Update during feature development, not as bulk refactoring
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### Phase 3: Test Organization (Planned)

**Status**: Not started
**Priority**: Low

**Goals**:
- Review test file sizes and organization
- Extract common test utilities
- Improve test readability
- Ensure comprehensive coverage

---

### Phase 4: Documentation (Planned)

**Status**: Not started
**Priority**: Low

**Goals**:
- Ensure all extracted modules have clear documentation
- Update architectural diagrams if needed
- Document design decisions and patterns
- Update CLAUDE.md with refactoring guidelines

- ‚úÖ Run full test suite after each extraction
- ‚úÖ Run CI to verify no regressions
- ‚úÖ No behavioral changes allowed

### 2. Incremental Progress
- ‚úÖ Small, focused refactorings
- ‚úÖ One extraction at a time
- ‚úÖ Commit after each successful refactoring
- ‚úÖ Can be reviewed and understood easily

### 3. Clear Separation
- ‚úÖ Each module has single, well-defined responsibility
- ‚úÖ Clear interfaces between modules
- ‚úÖ Minimize coupling between components
- ‚úÖ Use dependency injection where appropriate

### 4. Maintainability
- ‚úÖ Code is easier to read and understand
- ‚úÖ Modules can be tested independently
- ‚úÖ Changes are localized to relevant modules
- ‚úÖ Follow Go idioms and best practices

### 5. Documentation
- ‚úÖ Clear commit messages explaining changes
- ‚úÖ Code comments for non-obvious logic
- ‚úÖ Update documentation as needed
- ‚úÖ Track progress in this file

- **Approach**: Bottom-up refactoring of large files first
- **Timeline**: No fixed timeline, prioritizing quality over speed
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing required for each change
- **Review**: Each refactoring should be reviewable as a standalone change
