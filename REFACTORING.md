# Navigator Refactoring Plan and Status

This document tracks the ongoing refactoring effort to improve code maintainability, reduce complexity, and enhance separation of concerns in the Navigator codebase.

## Overall Goals

1. **Reduce file complexity**: Break down large files into smaller, focused modules
2. **Improve separation of concerns**: Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility
3. **Enhance maintainability**: Make code easier to understand, test, and modify
4. **Eliminate duplication**: Extract common patterns into reusable components
5. **Maintain stability**: All refactoring must pass existing tests with no behavioral changes

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Large File Analysis

### Completed Refactorings

#### ✅ internal/server/handler.go (COMPLETED)

**Original size**: 722 LOC
**Final size**: 343 LOC (52% reduction)

**Extractions performed**:

1. **Static File Handling** → `internal/server/static.go` (263 LOC)
   - Created `StaticFileHandler` type
   - Methods: `ServeStatic`, `TryFiles`, `ServeFallback`, `getPublicDir`
   - Handles root path stripping, extension checking, file resolution
   - Commit: `b8606b7` (Sep 30, 2025)

2. **MIME Type Detection** → `internal/server/mime.go` (30 LOC)
   - Replaced 40-line switch statement with stdlib `mime.TypeByExtension()`
   - Added fallback for font types not in stdlib
   - Simpler, more maintainable implementation
   - Commit: `b8606b7` (Sep 30, 2025)

3. **Access Logging** → `internal/server/access_log.go` (119 LOC)
   - Extracted `AccessLogEntry` struct
   - Created `LogRequest()` function for centralized logging
   - Handles client IP extraction, user info, timing, metadata
   - Commit: `aacd4d0` (Sep 30, 2025)

**Benefits achieved**:
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Improved testability (each module can be tested independently)
- ✅ Cleaner handler focused on request routing
- ✅ Easier to maintain and modify
- ✅ All 100+ tests passing
- ✅ No behavioral changes

#### ✅ cmd/navigator-refactored/main.go (COMPLETED)

**Date**: Sep 30, 2025
**Commit**: `9c47f67`

**High-priority fixes applied**:

1. **Extracted Log Level Parsing** → `getLogLevel()` helper
   - Eliminated duplicate log level parsing code
   - Single source of truth for log configuration

2. **Server Lifecycle Management** → `ServerLifecycle` type
   - Encapsulates signal handling and shutdown logic
   - Methods: `Run()`, `handleReload()`, `handleShutdown()`
   - Reduced main() from ~67 LOC to ~20 LOC

3. **Context Propagation** → Added to cleanup functions
   - `CleanupWithContext()` in webapp.go
   - `StopManagedProcessesWithContext()` in manager.go
   - Proper timeout handling during graceful shutdown

**Benefits achieved**:
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable main function
- ✅ Better signal handling architecture
- ✅ Improved graceful shutdown with context timeouts
- ✅ All tests passing

## Upcoming Work

### Phase 1: Large File Analysis (In Progress)

#### ⏭️ internal/process/webapp.go (651 LOC)

**Status**: Pending review
**Priority**: Medium

**Potential refactoring opportunities**:
- Extract process lifecycle management
- Separate port allocation logic
- Extract environment variable handling
- Consider splitting into multiple focused files

**Next steps**:
1. Review file for complexity and duplication
2. Identify extraction opportunities
3. Create refactoring plan
4. Implement and test

#### ⏸️ cmd/navigator-legacy/main.go (3842 LOC)

**Status**: Excluded from current refactoring
**Reason**: Legacy implementation, focus is on navigator-refactored

---

### Phase 2: Code Duplication (Planned)

**Status**: Not started
**Priority**: Medium

**Areas to investigate**:
- Error handling patterns
- Logging patterns across modules
- Common helper functions that could be extracted
- Configuration validation logic
- Test setup/teardown code

**Approach**:
1. Use static analysis to identify duplicated code blocks
2. Extract common patterns into shared utilities
3. Create helper packages as needed
4. Update all usages to use extracted code

---

### Phase 3: Test Organization (Planned)

**Status**: Not started
**Priority**: Low

**Goals**:
- Review test file sizes and organization
- Extract common test utilities
- Improve test readability
- Ensure comprehensive coverage

---

### Phase 4: Documentation (Planned)

**Status**: Not started
**Priority**: Low

**Goals**:
- Ensure all extracted modules have clear documentation
- Update architectural diagrams if needed
- Document design decisions and patterns
- Update CLAUDE.md with refactoring guidelines

---

## Refactoring Principles

### 1. Safety First
- ✅ All tests must pass before and after refactoring
- ✅ Run full test suite after each extraction
- ✅ Run CI to verify no regressions
- ✅ No behavioral changes allowed

### 2. Incremental Progress
- ✅ Small, focused refactorings
- ✅ One extraction at a time
- ✅ Commit after each successful refactoring
- ✅ Can be reviewed and understood easily

### 3. Clear Separation
- ✅ Each module has single, well-defined responsibility
- ✅ Clear interfaces between modules
- ✅ Minimize coupling between components
- ✅ Use dependency injection where appropriate

### 4. Maintainability
- ✅ Code is easier to read and understand
- ✅ Modules can be tested independently
- ✅ Changes are localized to relevant modules
- ✅ Follow Go idioms and best practices

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Clear commit messages explaining changes
- ✅ Code comments for non-obvious logic
- ✅ Update documentation as needed
- ✅ Track progress in this file
