# Navigator Refactoring Guide

## Overview

This document describes the refactored structure of the Navigator codebase, transforming it from a single 3800-line file into a well-organized multi-package Go application.

## New Package Structure

```

```

## Package Responsibilities

### 1. `internal/config`
- **types.go**: All configuration structs and constants
- **loader.go**: YAML file loading, parsing, and configuration updates
- Handles variable substitution for multi-tenant configurations

### 2. `internal/process`
- **manager.go**: External process lifecycle (Redis, Sidekiq, etc.)
- **webapp.go**: Web application process management
- **hooks.go**: Server and tenant lifecycle hooks
- **logging.go**: Log formatting (text/JSON), file output, Vector integration
- Dynamic port allocation and PID file management
- Process monitoring and auto-restart capabilities

### 3. `internal/auth`
- HTTP Basic Authentication via htpasswd files
- Path exclusion patterns for public resources
- Regex-based authentication rules
- Integration with go-htpasswd library

### 4. `internal/idle`
- Fly.io machine idle management
- Request tracking for auto-suspend/stop
- Resume hook execution after wake
- Configurable idle timeouts and actions

### 5. `internal/server`
- Main HTTP request handler
- Request routing and location matching
- Static file serving and try_files logic
- Integration with all other subsystems
- Access logging and metrics

### 6. `internal/proxy`
- Reverse proxy implementation
- WebSocket connection handling
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fly-Replay header management
- Sticky session routing

### 7. `internal/utils`
- Request ID generation
- Tenant name extraction
- PID file management
- Signal handling utilities
- Common helper functions

## Migration Benefits

### Maintainability
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each package has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Easier Testing**: Individual packages can be unit tested in isolation
- **Code Navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant code
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Smaller files are easier to understand

### Scalability
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different packages
- **Feature Addition**: New features can be added as new packages
- **Dependency Management**: Clear dependency boundaries between packages

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Shared types in config package prevent inconsistencies
- **Interface Design**: Clean interfaces between packages
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling patterns
- **Logging**: Consistent logging across all packages

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Structure Creation (Completed)
✅ Create internal package directories
✅ Extract type definitions to config/types.go
✅ Move configuration loading to config/loader.go
✅ Extract process management code
✅ Extract authentication logic
✅ Create utilities package

### Phase 2: Full Implementation (Next Steps)
1. Complete server package with all HTTP handling logic
2. Implement full proxy package with WebSocket support
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Create unit tests for each package
5. Add integration tests

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Add connection pooling to proxy package
2. Implement caching layer for static files
3. Add metrics collection
4. Performance profiling and optimization

## Testing Strategy

Each package should have corresponding tests:

```
internal/
├── auth/
│   ├── auth.go
│   └── auth_test.go
├── config/
│   ├── loader.go
│   ├── loader_test.go
│   ├── types.go
│   └── types_test.go
├── process/
│   ├── manager.go
│   └── manager_test.go
```

## Dependencies

The refactored structure maintains the same minimal dependencies:
- `github.com/tg123/go-htpasswd` - Authentication
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` - Configuration parsing
- Standard library for everything else

## Implementation Notes

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The original main.go remains unchanged
2. **Gradual Migration**: Can migrate to refactored structure incrementally
3. **Configuration Compatible**: Uses the same YAML configuration format
4. **No Breaking Changes**: External API and behavior remain identical
