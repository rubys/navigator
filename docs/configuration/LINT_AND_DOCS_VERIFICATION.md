# Lint Checks and Documentation Verification

Verification report for the `normalize_trailing_slashes` feature implementation.

## Documentation Updates ✅

### 1. YAML Reference Documentation

**File:** `docs/configuration/yaml-reference.md`

**Changes made:**

#### Added to configuration table (line 181):
```markdown
| `normalize_trailing_slashes` | boolean | `false` | Redirect directories to trailing slash URLs |
```

#### Added detailed explanation (line 199):
```markdown
**Normalize Trailing Slashes**: When enabled, Navigator checks if a path without a
trailing slash is a directory containing `index.html`. If found, it issues a
`301 Moved Permanently` redirect to the path with a trailing slash. This ensures
relative paths in the HTML work correctly (e.g., `<img src="logo.png">` resolves
to `/studios/boston/logo.png` instead of `/studios/logo.png`). This matches
standard nginx/Apache behavior.
```

#### Updated examples (lines 15-18, 80-92, 163-177):
All three YAML examples in the reference documentation now include:
```yaml
static:
  normalize_trailing_slashes: true  # Redirect directories to trailing slash
```

## Lint Checks ✅

All linting tools passed successfully:

### 1. gofmt (Code Formatting)

```bash
$ gofmt -s -l .
(no output - all files properly formatted)
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Action taken:** Auto-formatted `internal/config/types.go` to align struct tags properly.

---

### 2. go vet (Static Analysis)

```bash
$ go vet ./...
(no output - no issues found)
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Checks performed:**
- Suspicious constructs
- Printf format mismatches
- Unreachable code
- Shadow variables
- Incorrect struct tags

---

### 3. golangci-lint (Comprehensive Linting)

```bash
$ golangci-lint run --timeout=5m
(no output - all checks passed)
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Linters included:**
- errcheck (unchecked errors)
- gosimple (code simplification)
- govet (static analysis)
- ineffassign (ineffectual assignments)
- staticcheck (comprehensive checks)
- unused (unused code)
- And many more...

ok  	github.com/rubys/navigator/internal/utils	1.634s	coverage: 78.8%
```

**Status:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASS

### Coverage highlights:
- **internal/config**: 87.5% (new config option included)
- **internal/server**: 79.3% (directory redirect logic included)
- **internal/proxy**: 89.0% (highest coverage)

### New tests added for normalize_trailing_slashes:
1. Directory without trailing slash redirects (when enabled)
2. Directory with trailing slash serves index.html
3. Directory without index.html does not redirect
4. Feature disabled does not redirect

All 4 test cases passing ✅
